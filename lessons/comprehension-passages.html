      <h3>Passage 1: The Clever Rabbit</h3>
      <p>
        Once upon a time, in a dense forest filled with tall trees and singing birds, lived a clever rabbit. 
        He was known among all the animals for his intelligence and quick thinking. One bright morning, as he hopped near the riverbank searching for fresh grass, he noticed something unusual. 
        It was a trap set by a hunter, hidden cleverly beneath a pile of leaves. The rabbit carefully observed the trap, understanding the danger it posed. 
        Instead of panicking, he came up with a plan. He dragged a heavy log near the trap and tied it to a stick so that when the hunter tried to lift the trap, it would fall on him. 
        That very day, the hunter returned, unaware of the rabbit’s trick. As he attempted to lift the trap, the log fell, and the hunter ran away in fear. 
        All the animals in the forest celebrated the rabbit’s bravery and cleverness, learning an important lesson: intelligence and caution can overcome even the greatest dangers.

        Yesterday, the sky was covered with thick, gray clouds, and soon heavy rain began to fall, drumming against the roofs of houses and splashing into the streets. 
        The children, excited by the sudden rainfall, ran outside to jump and splash in the puddles, laughing and shouting with joy. Some of them wore bright raincoats, while others simply enjoyed getting wet. 
        Meanwhile, inside the warm homes, other children sat by the windows reading books or drawing pictures, enjoying the soothing sound of the rain. 
        The garden, which had been dry and dusty for weeks, became fresh and green. Flowers opened their petals to catch the droplets, and the grass seemed to grow taller. Birds chirped happily, enjoying the fresh water, and small streams formed along the pathways, sparkling in the dim light. 
        Even though some people were wet and had to dry themselves afterward, everyone agreed that the rain had brought happiness and a sense of calm to the day. Rain reminded the children and adults alike that nature provides life and refreshment for the world around us.
