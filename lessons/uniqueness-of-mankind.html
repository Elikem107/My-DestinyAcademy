    <h2>Topic: Uniqueness of Mankind</h2>
  </header>

  <section>
    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>
      The word <strong>“unique”</strong> means being one of a kind or special. 
      When we say mankind is unique, we mean that God created human beings 
      differently from all other creatures. According to the Bible, in 
      <strong>Genesis 1:26-27</strong>, God said, 
      <em>“Let us make man in our image, after our likeness.”</em> 
      This means that humans were created to resemble God in knowledge, righteousness, 
      and holiness.
    </p>

    <h2>Detailed Explanation</h2>
    <p>
      God gave man special qualities that make him different from animals and other forms of life. 
      Humans can think, plan, and make decisions. We can create new things, care for others, 
      and understand right from wrong. These qualities make us unique and responsible beings 
      before God.
    </p>

    <h3>1. Physical Uniqueness</h3>
    <p>
      Every person has a different appearance — face shape, voice, fingerprints, and skin color. 
      No two people are exactly the same, not even identical twins! This shows how wonderfully 
      and creatively God made us. 
    </p>

    <h3>2. Intellectual Uniqueness</h3>
    <p>
      Humans have the power to think deeply, to learn, to invent, and to solve problems. 
      We can use our intelligence to make the world a better place.
    </p>

    <h3>3. Spiritual Uniqueness</h3>
    <p>
      Unlike animals, humans can worship God, pray, and understand spiritual truths. 
      We know right from wrong and are able to make moral decisions. 
      God expects us to use these abilities to live righteous and peaceful lives.
    </p>

    <h3>4. Social Uniqueness</h3>
    <p>
      Humans live together, share love, and help one another. 
      We can form families, communities, and societies. 
      This teaches us to live in peace and harmony with others.
